# Focus_on_Today_project 
🌟 Focus on Today is a fully functional web project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It lets you add three daily tasks and track your progress as you complete them ✅. Once all tasks are entered, you can mark each one as complete using a check button 🗹. A dynamic progress bar visually updates to show how many out of three tasks you’ve finished 📊—helping you stay focused and productive throughout the day.

🖥️📱 This project is also responsive, meaning it works smoothly across different devices—whether you're using a phone, tablet, or laptop.
🎨 It features a clean, user-friendly design and was created by me as a practice project to strengthen my front-end development skills.
